Basic Rhythm Game

A simple rhythm game I work on as an exercise.

Current features:
 * basic menu and game scenes
 * adjustable scroll speed
 * configurable keybindings

ToDo:
- implement level pausing
- implement indicator counts
- implement long notes
- implement health system
- improve charting: "loadChart" function instead of "PlaceRandomNoteViaChart" coroutine
- add levels
- aesthetic update
- destroy indicators so that there is only ever one present at a time
