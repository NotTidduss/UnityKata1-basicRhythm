Basic Rhythm Game

A simple rhythm game I work on as an exercise.

Current features:
 * basic menu, game & result scenes
 * adjustable scroll speed
 * configurable keybindings
 * pausing
 * long & short notes

ToDo:
- improve charting: "loadChart" function instead of "PlaceRandomNoteViaChart" coroutine
- fix scroll speed
- add levels
- aesthetic update
- add sfx in menu
- QoL: show something meaningful when assigned key is assigned again
- QoC: destroy indicators so that there is only ever one present at a time
- QoC: optimize pausing
