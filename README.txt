Basic Rhythm Game

A simple rhythm game I work on as an exercise.

Current features:
 * basic menu and game scenes
 * adjustable scroll speed
 * configurable keybindings

ToDo:
- implement fading out of timing indicators
- decide whether timing indicators should cover notes
- refactor timing indicator code
- implement restart level functionality
- implement level pausing
- implement long notes
- implement health system
- improve charting: "loadChart" function instead of "PlaceRandomNoteViaChart" coroutine
- add levels
- aesthetic update
