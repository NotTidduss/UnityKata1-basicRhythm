Basic Rhythm Game

A simple rhythm game I work on as an exercise.

Current features:
 * basic menu and game scenes
 * adjustable scroll speed
 * configurable keybindings

ToDo:
- refactor keyindings coroutine
- fix slider position bug
- make score updates less clunky
- refactor coroutines in master
	- delegate more functions from master to new roles
- implement timing indicators
- implement restart level functionality
- implement level pausing
- implement long notes
- implement health system
- improve charting: "loadChart" function instead of "PlaceRandomNoteViaChart" coroutine
- add levels
- aesthetic update
