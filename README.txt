Basic Rhythm Game

A simple rhythm game I work on as an exercise.

Current features:
 * basic menu and game scenes
 * adjustable scroll speed
 * configurable keybindings
 * pausing

ToDo:
- only use one prefab for notes
- implement long notes
- implement health system
- show something meaningful when assigned key is assigned again
- improve charting: "loadChart" function instead of "PlaceRandomNoteViaChart" coroutine
- add levels
- implement result screen
- aesthetic update
- destroy indicators so that there is only ever one present at a time
- optimize pausing
- optimize scroll speed
- make every fixed value configurable in System
